DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 40, '1/8', 'ii%/vi') ms3.Parse.scarlatti_sonatas.K057
	The label 'ii%/vi' in m. 40, onset 1/8 (MC 40, onset 1/8) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of Bb.V, it expresses the scale degrees
	() [()].
	The corresponding score segment has 0 within-label and 2 out-of-label note onsets,
	a ratio of 1.0 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed
	by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
