DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 148, '1/8', 'V(64)') ms3.Parse.scarlatti_sonatas.K021
	The label 'V(64)' in m. 148, onset 1/8 (MC 148, onset 1/8) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of D.I, it expresses the scale degrees ('6', '2', '#4') [('B', 'E', 'G#')].
	The corresponding score segment has 1 within-label and 3 out-of-label note onsets, a ratio of 0.75 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
