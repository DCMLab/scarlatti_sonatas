Warnings encountered during the last execution of ms3 review (v1.2.10)
======================================================================

DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 24, '0', 'V.V') ms3.Parse.scarlatti_sonatas.K033
	The label 'V.V' in m. 24, onset 0 (MC 24, onset 0) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of D.V, it expresses the scale degrees ('3', '#5', '7') [('C#', 'E#', 'G#')].
	The corresponding score segment has 3 within-label and 6 out-of-label note onsets, a ratio of 0.6666666666666666 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
