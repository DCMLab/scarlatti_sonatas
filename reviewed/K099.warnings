DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 29, '1/8', 'V7/V') ms3.Parse.scarlatti_sonatas.K099
	The label 'V7/V' in m. 29, onset 1/8 (MC 29, onset 1/8) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of c.v, it expresses the scale degrees ('#6', '#1', '#3', '5') [('E', 'G#', 'B', 'D')].
	The corresponding score segment has 4 within-label and 11 out-of-label note onsets, a ratio of 0.7333333333333333 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
